--- User Profile for Ashwith ---
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is Ashwith, and they answered a questionnaire about their data science skills. The task is to analyze their answers and generate a TUTORING STRATEGY report.

First, I need to determine their knowledge level. The answers are: they've used Python for data analysis, are pretty familiar with NumPy and Pandas, haven't used GPU computing much, and never heard of NVIDIA-specific libraries like CuPy or RAPIDS.

So, they have some experience with Python and data manipulation libraries, which suggests they're not a beginner. But they don't know much about GPU computing or NVIDIA libraries. That seems like an intermediate level because they have foundational skills but lack advanced topics. Beginners might not even know NumPy, so intermediate makes sense here.

Now, the strategy format for intermediate says to start with the knowledge level, then explain that the tutor should provide direct code comparisons (like NumPy vs CuPy), focus on performance benefits, and show benchmarking examples. That fits because Ashwith knows the basics but needs to be shown how GPU acceleration can improve their work with specific examples. They might not know the libraries, so introducing them through code comparisons would be effective. Also, emphasizing performance benefits would help them understand why it's useful. Benchmarking examples would make it concrete.

I should check if there's any ambiguity. They said "pretty much" familiar with NumPy/Pandas, which is good, but not advanced. The lack of GPU experience points to needing more guidance there. So the intermediate strategy is appropriate. No need to go to advanced, as they haven't mentioned anything about the RAPIDS ecosystem or Sol supercomputer. The report should follow the intermediate format exactly as specified.

Knowledge Level: Intermediate  
TUTORING STRATEGY: The user is at an intermediate level. The tutor should provide direct code comparisons (e.g., NumPy vs. CuPy), focus on performance benefits, and show clear benchmarking examples. Emphasize practical applications of GPU acceleration for data processing, and introduce NVIDIA-specific libraries like CuPy and RAPIDS as tools to bridge the gap between traditional CPU-based workflows and high-performance computing. Use hands-on examples to demonstrate how these libraries can simplify complex tasks and improve efficiency.
